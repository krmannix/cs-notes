Getting Real

<h3>Intro:</h3>
	* Less is more - about building the real thing
	* Start with interface, work backwards from there
	* Launching, tweaking, constantly improving
	* "Every word tell" - William Strunk Jr.

<h3>The Starting Line:</h3>
* LESS - be simple. Underdo your competition.
* Build Software for Yourself
	* If you're the customer, you'll know exactly what you want
* Fund Yourself
	* Outside money brings expectations
	* Constraints inspire creativity
* Flex Scope
	* Always launch on time and budget.
		* If changes are needed, flex the scope. 
		* Throwing money at a problem does not fix it
	* Allows focus on:
		* Prioritization
		* Reality
		* Flexibility
			* Half a project is better than a half-assed project
* Have an Enemy
	* Sometimes the best way to know what your app is, is what it isn't
	* Have your product be something completely different
	* People understand products by comparing it with others
	* Don't follow the leader && don't get too obsessed with competition!
* It Shouldn't Be a Chore
	* Enjoy the process - if you don't love building it, something's wrong!

<h3>Stay Lean:</h3>
* Less Mass
	* The leaner, the easier to change (inertia!!)
	* Caused by:
		* Long term contracts
		* Excess staff
		* Meetings about other meetings
		* Technology lock-ins
		* Past ruling the future
		* Office politics
	* Reduced by:
		* Just-in-time thinking
		* Less software, less code
		* Multi-tasking team members
		* _Easy to admit mistakes_
		* Small team size
		* Less features
* Lower Cost of Change
	* Change is your best friend
	* Money can't buy agility
	* Simple rules lead to complex behavior. Complex rules lead to stupid behavior (tax laws, for example).
* Three Musketeers
	* Designer. Developer. Sweeper.
	* Lack of manpower forces priorities to be assessed
	* If you can't build version 1 with 3 people:
		* You need different people
		* Slim down your initial version
	* Metcalfe's law: "the value of a communication system grows at approximately the square of users of the system"
* Embrace Constraints
	* There's never enough time, people, money
		* Let these drive innovation & force focus
	* Constraints are advantages in disguise
* Be Yourself
	* Friendly and communicative
		* Small companies enjoy fewer formalities, less bureauracy, and more freedom
		* Customer service is always the biggest request

<h3>Priorities:</h3>
* What's the Big Idea
	* Explicit vision is key: One sentence should suffice
	* Make Mantra - why you exist
* Ignore details early on
	* Success & satisfaction is in the details
		* However, they kill morale and cause stagnantation
	* Get the stuff on the page, make sure it works, then adjust and perfect it
	* Work from large to small. Always
* It's a Problem When It's a Problem
	* Just wing it
	* Don't waste time on problems you don't have yet
* Hire the Right Customers
	* The customer is not always right
	* If you try and please everyone, you won't please anyone
* Scale Later
	* You don't have a scaling problem yet
	* _Create a great app & then worry about what to do once it's widly successful_
* Make Opinionated Software
	* Best software has a vision

<h3>Feature Selection</h3>
* Half, not Half-assed
	* Take whatever you think your product should be an cut it in half
* It Just Doesn't Matter
	* Essentials only
	* The best programmers are the ones who can determine what just doesn't matter
* Start with "No"
	* Make features work hard to be implemented
		* Each feature is like adopting a child. You need to grow it
	* Don't be a "Yes" man
* Hidden Costs
	* For each feature, ensure you understand hidden costs
		* Simple idea can snowball into major headache
* Can you handle it?
	* Build something you can manage
	* It's easy to make promises. It's much harder to keep them.
* Human Solutions
	* Build software for general concepts and encourage people to make their own solutions
		* Dont't force convention
* Forget Feature Requests
	* Let customers remind, not dictate, what's important
* Hold the Mayo
	* Ask people what they __don't__ want

<h3>Process</h3>
* Race to Running Software
	* Running software is the best motivation
	* Real things lead to real reactions
* Rinse & Repeat
	* Work in iterations - don't expect to get it right the first time
	* Iterations lead to liberation
* From Idea to Implementation
	* Brainstorm -> Sketches -> HTML -> Coding
		* Brainstorm:
			* What is this product gonna do?
			* No details, big questions
		* Paper sketches:
			* Quick, dirty, cheap. Boxes, circles, lines
		* HTML:
			* Mock-up in raw HTML so everyone can see what it looks like. No functinality
		* Coding:
			* Finally, plug-in the backend
* Avoid preferences
	* Decide little details so customers don't have to
	* Preferences are an excuse to avoid tough decisions
* "Done!"
	* Decisions are temporary. Finish and move on. 
	* No "paralyis through analysis"
* Test In the Wild
	* No substitute for real-world testing
	* Don't have beta/real version. Have them be the same.
		* Beta will get superficial walkthrough.
	* Sprikle Beta features in
* Shrink Your Time
	* Break it down
		* Break down timeframes

<h3>The Organization</h3>
* Unity
	* Don't split into silos
		* Facilitates communication between all processes
		* Members see spot within app as a whole
	* More harmonious product
* Alone Time
	* People need uninterrupted time to get things done
	* "In the zone"
	* Alone-time-zone is when real development happens
	* Simple rule: Make half the day "Alone Time"
* Meetings are TOXIC
	* Don't have meetings - simplify a concept
	* They suck:
		* Take time out of the day.
		* Are abstract concepts, not real things
		* Often contain one moron
		* Require preparation no one does
	* If meeting is REQUIRED:
		* Set a 30 minute timer.
		* Invite as few people as possible
		* Never have a meeting without a clear agenda
* Seek and Celebrate Small Victories
	* Release something today
		* Long release cycles are motivation killers
		* __Celebrate__ these

<h3>Staffing</h3>
* Hire Less & Hire Later
	* Add slow to go fast
	* "Adding people to a late software product makes it later" - Brooks' law.
* Kick the Tires
	* Work with potential employees on test-basis first
		* Maybe this consists of a 20-40 hour project?
* Actions, not Words
	* Judge potential tech hires on open-source contributions
		* Can you trust a resume?
* Get Well-Rounded Individuals
	* Go for quick-learning generalists over ingrained specialists
* Can't Fake Enthusiasm
	* Happy & average over frustrated & great
* Wordsmiths
	* Hire good writers
		* Good writers know how to communicate
		* </h4>BREVITY!!</h4>

<h3>Interface Design</h3>
* Interface First
	* Programming is the heavist part of building an app. Do this last.
	* Your interface is your product
* Epicenter Design
	* Start from one page and branch out
	* Whatever page you absolutely can't live without is the epicenter
* Three-State Solution
	* Regular
		* What users see when everything is working & app is flush with data
	* Blank
		* Screen see when people using app for first time, without data
	* Error
		* The screen people see when something went wrong
* Blank Slate
	* Set expectations for a thoughtful first-run experience
		* Ignoring this is one of the biggest mistakes you can make
	* Customer decides if product is worthy at this state
	* Insert quick blurbs or tips here
	* _First impressions are cruicial_
* Get Defensive
	* Design for when things go wrong
		* Get make or break site
* Context Over Consistency
	* What makes sense might not make sense there
	* It's okay to be inconsistent if it makes more sense design-wise
* Copywriting is Interface Design
	* Every letter matters
		* Can't get away with technical jargon
* One Interface
	* Incorporate admin functionality into public design
		* If you have to maintain two seperare interfaces, you will suffer

<h3>Code</h3>
* Less Software
	* Keep code as simple as possible
		* Each time you increase the amount of code, your codebase gets exponentially more complicated
			* There is a cascade effect
	* Restate hard problems into much simpler ones
		* You may not be solving the same problem, but that's alright
	* Easier to manage, onboard, lowers cost of change, fewer bugs
	* Encourage programmers to push back & make counteroffers
* Optimize for Happiness
	* A happy programmer is a productive programmer
	* Languages are not created equal
		* Do not choose tools based on industry standards
* Code Speaks
	* Listen when your code pushes back
	* If something is too complicated, code is telling you there's probably a better way
* Manage Debt
	* Pay off your code & design "bills"
	* Hack something together that's functional but still a bit hairy and you're building debt
	* It's okay to do this sometimes - actually, it's inline with Getting-Real-ASAP
		* However, make sure to occasionally put aside time to refactor
* Open Doors
	* Get data out into the world via RSS, APIs, etc.
	* Lets community grow & developers add value to your product

<h3>Words</h3>
* There's Nothing Functional About a Function Spec
	* They are fantasies
	* About appeasement
		* Making everyone feel involved and happy
		* Never about tough choices or exposing costs
	* Illusion of agreement
	* Lead to future overload
	* Don't allow for evolution & reassessment
* Don't Do Dead Documents
	* Eliminate unnecessary documents - THIS GOES WITHOUT SAYING
