# cs-notes

Collection of notes about CS &amp; CE topics

<h3>Information</h3>


Structure is as follows:

* *Books* contains notes compiled from textbooks or guides. Include examples if relevant, and attempt to follow the book's table of contents as the logical order to dictate your notes

* *Conferences* contains note compiled from lecture talks or deep-dives from conferences or events. Please create a seperate folder for an event or conference, and within that folder create seperate files for each distinct talk or lecture. For "lighting" style talks, it is okay to include all talks within the same document. Lectures that were not viewed as an audience member but rather remotely can also be included in this bucket

* *Topics* contains general notes that apply to specific topics. At the root level, folders will filter that note's intended topic at a high level. There may be cases where a set of notes might apply to multiple folders - it is up to the discretion of the author to place the set of notes in whichever folder they find appropriate, but please intend to look for the most specific topic folder. Within the root level folders exist more granular filtering of topics. Feel free to add new folders when necessary.

_Note_: Please create all notes in GitHub Markdown syntx, which was choosen due to support off multiline `code` formatting without the need of indenting. To use multliline `code` formatting, wrap your intended code block in triple backticks (` \`\`\` `)
