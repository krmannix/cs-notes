<h3>WSGI</h3>

WSGI is the glue that holds all the components of a framework together. It provides an API for Python web applications to interface with web servers in order to promote web application portability across a variety of servers. It is an interface specification by which a server and application communicate. It receives requests from a client and passes it to the application, and then returns the response provided by the application to the client. 

mod_wsgi is an Apache implementation of WSGI.
